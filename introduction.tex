At the beginning of each software project, its developers face an important
question: To open source or not to open source? That question oversimplifies the
issue, since developers use a variety of other models that are a mixture of
open source and closed source models. Many developers decide almost
instinctively, since they often have strong opinions on the subject. For the
founder of the GNU Project and the Free Software Movement, Richard Stallman, the
question should not be taken lightly.
