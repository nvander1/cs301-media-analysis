At the beginning of each software project, its developers face an important
question: to open source or not to open source? Many developers decide almost
instinctively, since they often have strong opinions on the subject. For Richard
Stallman, the creator of GNU, question should not be taken lightly. While some
may find Stallman a bit of a fanatic, he does have a point--that
question oversimplifies the issue, since developers use a variety of other
models that are a mixture of open source and closed source models.
