	In a talk given to university students in Paris, Richard Stallman warns of the dangers of being a prisoner of the digital world. As a computer scientist, Stallman seems like the least likely candidate to preach against a digital lifestyle. However, Stallman takes issue not with computers, and software on their own, but rather software, and services that he believes disrespect their users' freedom. He believes that proprietary software allows companies to insert malicious code—code that can spy on users. Companies that make software that collects information on users, he says, are not only denying users freedom of privacy, but the mere fact that the software's source is kept a secret, gives these companies control over their customers. To combat this loss of control, he says “we have to extract people from digital society if it doesn't respect their freedom or we have to make it respect their freedom.”
