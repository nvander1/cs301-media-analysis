In a talk given to university students in Paris, Richard Stallman warns of the 
dangers of being a prisoner of the digital world. As a computer scientist, 
Stallman seems like the least likely candidate to preach against a digital 
lifestyle. However, Stallman takes issue not with computers, and software on 
their own, but rather software, and services that he believes disrespect their 
users' freedom. He believes that proprietary software allows companies to 
insert malicious code—code that can spy on users. Companies that make software 
that collects information on users, he says, are not only denying users freedom 
of privacy, but the mere fact that the software's source is kept a secret, 
gives these companies control over their customers. To combat this loss of 
control, he says “we have to extract people from digital society if it doesn't 
respect their freedom or we have to make it respect their freedom.”

Proprietary software he says, does not respect students' right to learn. He 
believes that schools should use only free software--software that is
open-source and has no restrictions on its use. The only way to write good code,
he says is by first reading lots of good code, and emulating the writing styles,
and patterns in it. Learning is about the exchange of ideas; Stallman thinks
that proprietary software promotes the idea of hiding your information rather
than sharing it. He believes that classrooms should not allow students to
keep their code to themselves. Classes encourage students to share their ideas
and discuss them, and programming classes should not be an exception to that
rule he believes.
