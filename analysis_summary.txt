In a talk given to university students in Paris, Richard Stallman warns of the
dangers of being a prisoner of the digital world. As a computer scientist,
Stallman seems like the least likely candidate to preach against a digital
lifestyle. However, Stallman takes issue not with computers, and software on
their own, but rather software, and services that he believes disrespect their
users' freedom. He believes that proprietary software allows companies to
insert malicious code—code that can spy on users. Companies that make software
that collects information on users, he says, are not only denying users freedom
of privacy, but the mere fact that the software's source is kept a secret,
gives these companies control over their customers. To combat this loss of
control, he says “we have to extract people from digital society if it doesn't
respect their freedom or we have to make it respect their freedom.”

Stallman lists four rules that software must follow to respect users' freedom:
    - Freedom 0 is the freedom to run the program as you wish.
    - Freedom 1 is the freedom to study the source code and change it, so the
    program does your computing the way you wish
    - Freedom 2 is the freedom to help others. That's the freedom to make exact
    copies and redistribute them when you wish.
    - Freedom 3 is the freedom to contribute to your community. That's the
    freedom to make copies of your modified versions, if you have any, and then
    distribute them to others when you wish.
To realize his vision of a world of only free software, Stallman started the
GNU Project, and Free Software Movement. Through these he shares ideas of how
software should be used, as well as software that follows his vision. He
discusses his main application for free software: education. "Schools must teach
exclusively free software," he preaches.
